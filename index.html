	<b>Doradus</b> is an open source storage and query engine that runs on top of the Cassandra NoSQL database. It provides a high-level data model, Lucene-based query language, and sophisticated aggregate queries with multi-level grouping. You can embed Doradus in an application or execute it standalone with the bundled Jetty server or another web server to provide a REST API. Multiple storage services are available that organize data using techniques designed to benefit specific application types:
	<ul>
	<li>
The <b>OLAP service</b> borrows techniques from Online Analytical Processing, columnar storage, compression, and sharding to yield extremely compact databases. Doradus OLAP requires applications to organize data into time-based shards, and it prefers batch updates of semi-mutable data. For applications that can meet these constraints, databases are extremely compact, and analytic queries can search millions of objects per second.<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
	The <b>Spider service</b> is suitable for data that is highly mutable, semi-structured to unstructured, and/or requires fine-grained updates. Updates are instantly reflected in searches, and objects can be updated simultaneously by different applications. Spider is ideal for applications emphasizing full text searches on irregular data.<br/>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>Both OLAP and Spider support the Doradus Query Language (DQL) for object and aggregate queries. For a more detailed overview of Doradus click here. See the topics below for links to tutorials, examples, detailed documentation, and a simple 1-2-3 getting started process.</p>
