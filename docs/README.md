#About the PDF Docs
The PDFs in this folder contain the same information available in Wiki pages. They are intended to be stand-alone files that you can use for Doradus administration or while working with a specific storage service. As a result, there is some redundant information between the docs.

The storage services (Logging, OLAP, and Spider) all support the core Doradus data model and query language (DQL), but each service supports slightly different features and REST commands. Each PDF file is tailored to describe the features supported by the corresponding service. So, for example, you won't find anything about link fields in the Logging service document because it doesn't support links.

If you find any incorrect or missing information, please let us know!
