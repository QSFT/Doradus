/**
 * Abstract class that encapsulates a set of updates that will be committed together.
 * Provides methods to post updates based on a tabular model: add/replace column, delete
 * column, and delete row. These methods operate on a "store", which is a ColumnFamily in
 * Cassandra.
 * <p>
 * Because the application schema model is central to Doradus, methods are also provided
 * to add columns to an application's definition row and to delete an application's
 * definition row. These operations are performed on the Applications ColumnFamily in
 * Cassandra.
 * <p>
 * The accumulated updates are commited by calling {@link DBService#commit(DBTransaction)}
 * which also clears the updates. Updates can also be cleared by calling {@link #clear()}.
 * The transaction object subsequently can be reused, causing the same timestamp to be
 * used for all new updates. To use a new timestamp, a new object must be created.
