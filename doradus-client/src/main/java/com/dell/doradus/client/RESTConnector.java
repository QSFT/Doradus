/**
 * RESTConnector is a class that provides multiple connections to Doradus nodes.
 * It can generate RESTClient objects to different hosts. The class implements
 * a simple round robin strategy for selecting next host for connection.
 * It also provides a snap of connection state (when was connected last time).
 * Usage:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>RESTConnector connector = new RESTConnector(port, host1, host2,...);</li>
 * <li>RESTClient client1 = connector.getClient();</li>
 * <li>RESTClient client2 = connector.getClient();</li>
 * <li>Client dClient1 = new Client(client1);</li>
 * <li>Client dClient2 = new Client(client2);</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * </ol>
